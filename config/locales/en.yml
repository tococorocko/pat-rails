      <p>Parents as Teachers promotes the early development, learning, and health of children in early childhood by supporting and involving parents and caregivers.</p>

    subtitle_4: How one can participate in the project
    paragraph_4_html: |
      <p>Both professionals and families themselves can apply by calling the number <a target="_blank" href="tel:0041793753791">+41 79 375 37 91</a> or by writing to <a target="_blank" href="mailto:info@pat-ti.ch">info@pat-ti.ch</a>.</p>
      <p>If the family is interested, the PAT coordinator contacts the parents for an initial informational meeting, during which the project is presented. If the family is interested, the PAT Parent Counselor makes contact with the family and arranges at least two admission meetings (without commitment). Only after these 3 meetings can the family enter the project and commit to be part of it for at least 2 years.</p>
      <p class="bold">The project is voluntary and free for families.</p>

      <p class="citation">"Without its help and support I would have punished my son when he did not obey, I did not know how to handle him..."</p>
      <p class="citation">"It gave me a lot of play ideas, with household items that I would have thrown away..."</p>
      <p class="citation">"I don't know if my son would still be with me..."</p>
